## Game Rules

1. The game is played by two players.
2. Players take turns to roll a dice.
3. Each player's turn score is added to their current score unless they roll a 1, which ends their turn and forfeits their turn score.
4. Players can choose to "Hold", which adds their turn score to their total score and ends their turn.
5. The first player to reach the winning score (default is 100) wins the game.
